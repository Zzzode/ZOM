# Introduction

Zom is a modern, statically-typed programming language designed for building reliable, efficient, and maintainable software. It combines the best features from various programming paradigms while maintaining a focus on safety, performance, and developer productivity.

## Design Principles

- **Safety First**: Zom prevents common programming errors through its type system and memory safety guarantees
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient compilation to native code
- **Expressiveness**: Rich type system with pattern matching, generics, and functional programming features
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing C/C++ codebases
- **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages, powerful tooling, and intuitive syntax

## Language Features

- Static typing with type inference
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Pattern matching and algebraic data types
- Generics with associated types
- Async/await concurrency model
- Powerful error handling with Result types
- Module system with explicit imports/exports
- Compile-time code generation
